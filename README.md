# Fall Guys Clone 🎮

**Solo-level Fall Guys-inspired Game**

This project is a single-player obstacle course inspired by Fall Guys, developed to enhance my skills with Unity’s physics system and third-person controller setup. It was created during my early journey in Unity and reflects my growth from beginner to intermediate.

## 📝 Description
Players navigate through a colorful obstacle course filled with moving barriers, jumping platforms, and various challenges to reach the finish line. Although it’s a solo experience (non-multiplayer), this game captures core mechanics such as:
- Movement and collision handling
- Interactions with dynamic obstacles

**Note:** The game still has a few minor bugs I could easily address now, but I’ve preserved it in its original form as a testament to my progress.

## 🔗 Play the Game Online
You can try out the game via the **[WebGL build here](#)**. *Please note:* due to WebGL limitations, you may experience jitter, graphical errors, and other performance issues. For the best experience, download the **[Desktop build here](01 BUILDS/Executable/Fall Guys Clone (Single Player Offline).zip)**, which is fully functional and optimized for desktop play.
