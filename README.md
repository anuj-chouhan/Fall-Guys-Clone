# Fall-Guys-Clone
This solo-level Fall Guys-inspired game was made to enhance my skills with Unity’s physics system and third-person controllers. Players navigate obstacles to reach the finish line. It still has a few minor bugs I could easily address now, but I’ve preserved it in its original form to reflect my growth from beginner to intermediate in Unity.
